# Configuration options:
# max => maximum value of uid/gid that we're interested in/willing to allocate
#	from.  Can be set to - to go maximum possible 32-bit value.
# debug => if non-zero outputs some cryptic debug output (will inherit from environment).
#
max=500

# Basic Design:
#
# There is nothing beautiful about this script, it's downright nasty and I
# (Jaco Kroon <jaco@uls.co.za>) will be the first to admit that.
#
# For each of the uid and gid ranges, we primarily keep two variables.
# ranges and reason.  reason is simply one of USED or RESERVED.  Free ranges
# are not mapped into these arrays.
# ranges_ maps a start index onto an end index.  So for example, let's say
# uid range 0..10 is USED (allocated, for whatever purposes):
#
# ranges_uid[0]=10
# reasons_uid[0]=USED
#
# The above says that UID 0 to 10 is USED.
#
# We start with an initially empty set, and then insert into, either merging or
# potentially splitting as we go, by way of the consume function, once completed
# we compact some things and then output.
